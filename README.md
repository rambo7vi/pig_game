# pig_game
It is a game written in python language which needs to use dice to play.
There will be multiple number of player supposedly 'x'
All this 'x' players will roll a dice and whatever be the outcome other than 1 will be added to that specific players score.
After every roll the player has the option to stop or go for another roll until the outcome of the dice is 1.
When the outcome of dice roll is 1 then the players score becomes 0, if the player stops before this outcome he will have a specific score which he can compare with other players at the end
after all the players get their scores, this process runs until there is no players whose score has gone beyond a specific maximum value.
The first player to cross the maximum value wins out of all the 'X' participants.
